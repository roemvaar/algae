Test common routines:

Binary search:

* Tests for empty array
* Tests for element not found in the array
* Tests for unsuccesful search on left bound
* Tests for unsuccesful search on right bound
* Tests for succesful search on left bound
* Tests for succesful search on right bound
* Tests for element successful on middle
* Tests for element succesful on middle + 1 with even array size
* Tests for element succesful on middle + 1 with even array size
* Tests for an element from the middle cannot be found, for example 5 in [1, 2, 6, 10]
* Tests for succesful in the array contains duplicate values, for example 3 in [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
* Tests for unsuccesful in the array contains duplicate values, for example 4 in [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
* Test for unordered lists

Linked lists:

* counting the number of nodes in linked list
* reversing all in-place
* finding middle node
* merging two linked lists together
